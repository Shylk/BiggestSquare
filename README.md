# BiggestSquare
Find the biggest square possible in a map with obstacles.

Project made in __C__.

## Introduction
The project goals was to produce a program that was fast enough to find a square within a map of different sizes from 1 * 1 to 10 000 * 10 000.<br />
The algorithm used was a reversed minesweeper.

### Get started with the program
<br>You have to compile the program through the Makefile with __make__ <br />
Then the binary __./bsq__ takes a file as parameters.<br />

## Demonstration
### Example : 100 * 100 map
A map where we have to find the biggest square <br />
